1. Create a crappy blog thing as an "open source" repo on GitHub.

1. Make some PRs to yourself, and label them with `hacktoberfest-accepted`.

1. Profit.

At first I was a little worried that Digital Ocean would not be fooled by these shenanigans, but I
needn't have worried. It was a little annoying that I had to wait two weeks for the first PR to
"mature." I thought that I might have to make some real contributions to open source in order to get
a T-shirt.

Making _real_ contributions to open source is a good thing, but some people have jobs and spend too
much time working. Almost all of my open source contributions have been related to work.
So...**don't** spam open source projects with bogus PRs.
